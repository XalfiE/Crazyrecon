CrazyRecon is a sub-tool from Capt-Meelo's lazy recon (https://github.com/capt-meelo/LazyRecon) with various scripts that automates the tedious and redundant process of reconnaissance of a target domain. I have subsequently edited it to suit my bug bounty workflow.

CrazRecon utilizes the following tools:
- Subdomain Enumeration:
  - [Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)
  
- Subdomain Takeover:
  - [subjack](https://github.com/haccer/subjack)
  
- CORS Configuration:
  - [CORScanner](https://github.com/chenjj/CORScanner) 
  
- IP Discovery:
  - [Massdns](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns)
  
- Port Scanning:
  - [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan)
  - [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
  - [Nmap Bootstrap Stylesheet](https://github.com/honze-net/nmap-bootstrap-xsl/)
  
- Visual Recon:
  - [Aquatone](https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone)
  
- Content Discovery:
  - [Dirsearch](https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch)
  
- Wordlists:
  - [JHaddix's all.txt](https://gist.github.com/jhaddix/f64c97d0863a78454e44c2f7119c2a6a)
  - [SecLists' raft-large-words.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-words.txt)




Alfie's To-do list:
  - To add findomain to subdomain enumeration workflow
  - To add arjun / param miner to content discovery workflow
